This will be my first project as a coder once I complete my classes.  Despite having many years as a website developer on html/CSS side of things 
I have decided to move on to coding.  In particular, I am working on Swift (Obj-C), Ruby, and Java.  The first concept I have is a small 
one which will be open sourced and take a lot of time off of pressure for coders/billers in the behavioral health market.  All
I ask is for proper recognition.
